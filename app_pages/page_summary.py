        f"Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants. Many different species of fungi "
        f"cause powdery mildew diseases in the order of Erysipelas. It is one of the more manageable plant diseases to "
        f"identify, as its symptoms are quite distinctive. Infected plants display white powdery spots on the leaves "
        f"and stem. The lower leaves are the most affected, but mildew can appear on any above-ground part "
        f"of the plant. *[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powdery_mildew)*"

            f"* The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their " 
            f"cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is "
            f"to verify if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew manually."
            f"\nAn employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and" 
            f"verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If it has powdery mildew, "
            f"the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying "
            f"this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees on multiple " 
            f"farms nationwide. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time "
            f"spent in the manual process inspection.\n\n"
